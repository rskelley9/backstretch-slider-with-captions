Summary
--------------------------

This jQuery plugin is being built to help you easily use BackstretchJS to create reponsive sliders with captions. Text wrapped in HTML tags with particular classes (more details below) is paired with images in the backstretch slider. As each image is cycled, corresponding text is displayed and hidden. By adding additonal CSS classes like 'clickable', the slider becomes more interactive.
